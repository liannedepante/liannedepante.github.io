> Die Philosophen haben die Welt nur verschieden interpretiert, es kömmt drauf an sie zu verändern.

I’m an early-career academic with a multidisciplinary background in **political economy**, **public administration**, **Asian studies**, and **policy studies**. 

Currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, I earned my Master of Arts from National Chengchi University and my Bachelor of Public Administration from the University of the Philippines. 

For my **dissertation**, I intend to challenge how Philippine political economy is conventionally framed as neopatrimonial by looking at the history of the country's semiconductor industry.
