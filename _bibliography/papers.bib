   abstract = {While micro, small, and medium enterprises are widely considered as the backbone of the Philippine economy, their potential to contribute more to development is often hindered by high levels of informality. To help address the issue of enterprise informality, the government enacted the Barangay Micro-business Enterprises (BMBEs) Act of 2002, with the aim of formalizing microenterprises through the provision of incentives. Using data from a national-level census of BMBEs and business counselors directly involved in the implementation of the law, this study sought to evaluate the BMBE Law vis-à-vis its goal of reducing informality. In doing so, it focused on evaluating business registration, incentives and benefits received by the BMBEs, impact on microenterprises’ formalization rate, and impact on BMBEs’ business operations and development. Results from the descriptive statistics reveal that the law has been largely ineffective in addressing informality and fostering microenterprise development. In this light, this study recommends policy amendments to account for the recent enactment of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, administrative burdens, and conflicting regulatory priorities. However, given the lengthy legislative amendment process, a more immediate approach would be for implementing agencies to update the implementing rules and regulations and conduct awareness campaigns to enhance the policy’s reach and impact},

   abstract = {Alam et al.1 claim to have discovered a song feature, “path length”, that honestly signals male fitness and is therefore preferred by all females. However, their data and analyses provide no statistical support for this claim. (1) The key finding — that long-path songs are difficult to learn (Fig. 4c) — is a statistical artefact: regressing y minus x on x creates an illusory effect where none exists. (2) Their path-length estimates have a measurement error of 45-73%, which undermines their conclusions, including the claim that females prefer long-path songs. (3) This claim is based on playback experiments that use only three artificial stimulus pairs, which, given the measurement error, cannot reliably contrast long and short paths. In sum, there is no evidence that path length functions as an honest fitness indicator. Our re-evaluation highlights the importance of validating new methods and accounting for random noise in small datasets. Finally, we emphasise that in species where females are known to disagree on who is attractive2-6, searching for a trait that determines male attractiveness is unwarranted.},

#   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically altered human activities, potentially relieving human pressures on urban-dwelling animals. Here, we evaluated whether birds from five cities in five countries (Czech Republic – Prague, Finland – Rovaniemi, Hungary – Budapest, Poland – Poznan, and Australia – Melbourne) changed their tolerance towards human presence (measured as flight initiation distance) during the COVID-19 shutdowns. We collected 6369 flight initiation distance estimates for 147 bird species and found that birds tolerated approaching humans to a similar level before and during the COVID-19 shutdowns. Moreover, during the shutdowns, bird escape behaviour did not consistently change with the level of governmental restrictions (measured as the stringency index). Hence, our results indicate that birds do not flexibly and quickly adjust their escape behaviour to the reduced human presence; in other words, the breeding populations of urban birds examined might already be tolerant of human activity and perceive humans as relatively harmless.},
